In this lab you will have to develop a server-side web application in PHP.
The web application has to manipulate a Mysql database with 1 to 3 tables and
should implement the following base operations on these tables: select, insert, delete, update.
Also the web application must use AJAX for getting data asynchronously from the web server
and the web application should contain at least 5 web pages
(client-side html or server-side php).

For the database, you can use the mysql database on www.scs.ubbcluj.ro.
On this mysql server you have an account, a password and a database, all identical to your username and password on the SCS network.

Write a web application for an e-commerce store.
The application should maintain information about the products it sells in the database.
The user should browse products by categories (use AJAX for this), add and remove products to a shopping cart.
Product browsing should be paged - products are displayed on pages with maximum 4 products on a page
(you should be able to go to the previous and the next page).
